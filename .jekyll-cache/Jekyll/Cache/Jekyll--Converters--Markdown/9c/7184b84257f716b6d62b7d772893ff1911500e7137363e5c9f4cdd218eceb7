I"Å<p><em>The martingale representation problem in its simplest form is the following. Given a filtration generated by a martingale <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and given another martingale <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> adapted to the filtration, can we express <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> as a stochastic integral with <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> as the integrator? The martingale <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is generally closed, i.e.Â it can be expressed as the conditional expectation of a terminal variable <span class="math inline">\(N_{T}\)</span>. In this case, the integrand <span class="math inline">\(H_{t}\)</span> of the stochastic integral representation is heuristically the sensitivity of <span class="math inline">\(N_{T}\)</span> to the shock <span class="math inline">\(dM_{t}\)</span>.The Brownian filtration is the most important example where a Martingale Representation Theorem holds.</em></p>
