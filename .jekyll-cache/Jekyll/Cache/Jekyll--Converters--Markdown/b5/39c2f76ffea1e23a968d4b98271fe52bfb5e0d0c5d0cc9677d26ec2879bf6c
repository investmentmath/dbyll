I"Æ<p><em>I review the impact on the future price level of random noise in the return process. This effect operates through the non-linearity of compounding. I look at how an increased level of volatility changes the price trajectories. Normally distributed (say) return variability lowers the median of the price distribution and skews it towards the upside. Over time, the skew increases as compounding operates. The majority of price trajectories are depressed by volatility. The mean price level is however unaffected as the lower trajectories are made up by a few â€˜explosiveâ€™ ones. This will be important to bear in mind when discussing portfolio choice and the effect of portfolio rebalancing.</em></p>
