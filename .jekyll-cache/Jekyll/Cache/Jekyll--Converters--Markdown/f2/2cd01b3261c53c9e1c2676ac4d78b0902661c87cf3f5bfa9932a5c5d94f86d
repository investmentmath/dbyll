I"ž<p><em>The purpose of this note is to introduce diffusions which are made up of a drift and a martingale component. I start from the elementary discrete time setup where the drift of the process is most easily understood. I then explain how the specialized decomposition of a diffusion into a drift and a Brownian integral can arise as the limit of the decompositions obtained on the discretized process.</em></p>
