I"p<p><em>This post introduces the Ito rule of stochastic calculus. This rule provides the semimartingale decomposition of a nonlinear (this being the non trivial case) function of given semimartingales. Its simplest incarnation is the product rule of stochastic calculus which gives the semimartingale decomposition of the product of two given semimartingales.</em></p>
