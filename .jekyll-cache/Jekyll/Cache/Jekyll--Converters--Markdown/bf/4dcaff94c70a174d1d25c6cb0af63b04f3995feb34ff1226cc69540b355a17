<h3 id="part-1-efficient-frontier-without-risk-free-asset-cale">Part 1: Efficient frontier, without risk free asset (<span class="math inline">\(\cal{E}\)</span>)</h3>
<p>The context is that of static optimization, i.e.Â decisions are taken in period <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and results are observed in period <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. There are <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> risky assets (<span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,N\)</span>) with stochastic rates of return <span class="math inline">\((\tilde{r}_{i})_{i=1,\ldots,N}\)</span>. Expected rates of return are noted <span class="math inline">\((\mu_{i})_{i=1,\ldots,N}\)</span> and the covariance matrix is <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is invertible (i.e.Â there are no redundant assets). The investor chooses portfolio weights <span class="math inline">\((\pi_{i})_{i=1,\ldots,N}\)</span> as a proportion of wealth <span class="math inline">\(W_{0}\)</span>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Which constraint applies to <span class="math inline">\((\pi_{i})_{i=1,\ldots,N}\)</span>?</li>
<li>Determine the relationship between wealth in date <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and wealth in date <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> using the system of weights. Express <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{r}_{p}\)</span>, the rate of return of the portfolio, as a function of the rates of return of the assets <span class="math inline">\((\tilde{r}_{i})_{i=1,\ldots,N}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Express the mean return and the variance of the portfolio as a function of the system of weights.</li>
<li>We are interested in the minimum variance portfolio. Define the corresponding optimization program. Derive the corresponding lagrangian and the solution of the optimization program. Its system of weights is denoted <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{1}\)</span> while <span class="math inline">\(\mu^{1}\)</span> denotes its expected return. Can a portfolio with expected return lower than <span class="math inline">\(\mu^{1}\)</span> be mean-variance efficient?</li>
<li>Consider an expected return objective <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p} \geq \mu^{1}\)</span>. We seek to minimize variance given this return objective. Define the corresponding constrained optimization program. Determine the lagrangian and the corresponding first order condition. Show that the Lagrange multipliers solve a linear system involving the following parameters:
<ul>
<li>the expected return of the portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p}\)</span>,</li>
<li>the vector <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> that consists of the expected return of the risky assets,</li>
<li>the covariance matrix of the risky assets.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>We will now assume: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\mu&#39;\Sigma^{-1}\mu}{e&#39;\Sigma^{-1}\mu}&gt;\mu^{1},\]</span> as well as <span class="math inline">\(e&#39;\Sigma^{-1}\mu&gt;0\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the vector of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s of size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Show that the linear system can be inverted.</li>
<li>Show that there is a value of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mu^{\mu}\)</span>, such that the Lagrange multiplier of the budget constraint is zero. Determine the corresponding portfolio, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{\mu}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Show that in the general case (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p} \geq \mu^{1}\)</span>), the mean-variance efficient portfolio is a linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{\mu}\)</span>. Determine the coefficients of this combination and show that they add to one. Explain why the Lagrange multiplier of the budget constraint decreases as we increase the return objective away from <span class="math inline">\(\mu^{1}\)</span>.</li>
<li>The efficient frontier is obtained as we move <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p}\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(\mu^{1}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>. Give its parametric form in the standard deviation (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis) expected return (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis) plane.</li>
<li>We have just shown that any efficient portfolio can be written as a combination of <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{\mu}\)</span>. Prove that instead, we could have taken two distinct arbitrary portfolios along the efficient frontier to describe the efficient frontier.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="partie-2-efficient-frontier-with-a-riskless-asset-calf">Partie 2: Efficient frontier with a riskless asset (<span class="math inline">\(\cal{F}\)</span>)</h3>
<p>We now add a riskless asset with rate of return <span class="math inline">\(r^{f}\)</span>, to which we ascribe the index <span class="math inline">\(i=0\)</span>. Each vector of portfolio weights can be decomposed into its cash component <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{0}\)</span> and the subportfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pi=(\pi_{i})_{i=1,\cdots,N}\)</span> entirely invested in risky assets (thus <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{0}+\pi&#39;e=1\)</span>).</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>Show that two optimal portfolios necessarily have the same Sharpe ratio. What is the shape of the efficient frontier <span class="math inline">\(\cal{F}\)</span> in the standard deviation (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis) expected return (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis) plane. The intersection between <span class="math inline">\(\cal{E}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\cal{F}\)</span> will be denoted <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>.</li>
<li>Characterize the geometric position of <span class="math inline">\(\cal{E}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\cal{F}\)</span> around <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. What is the name of the portfolio which corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>.</li>
<li>Given a return objective <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p}\)</span>, spell out the constrained optimization program that defines the minimum variance portfolio. What optimization program is satisfied by the risky sub-portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> (this problem will be denoted <span class="math inline">\({\cal P}(\mu_{p}-r^{f})\)</span>).</li>
<li>Show that two problems <span class="math inline">\({\cal P}(\mu^{p,1}-r^{f})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\cal P}(\mu^{p,2}-r^{f})\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(r^{f}&lt;\mu^{p,1}&lt;\mu^{p,2}\)</span> can be mapped to one another using a simple transformation. Show the the unique underlying problem <span class="math inline">\({\cal P}\)</span> consists in finding the risky asset portfolio with the maximum Sharpe ratio. Compute the maximum Sharpe ratio. Relate this result to question <span class="math inline">\(11\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="exercice-2">Exercice 2</h2>
<p>We consider a terminal utility of wealth problem, with term <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> (no consumption before <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>), in the continuous time setup. Terminal utility of wealth is CRRA: <span class="math display">\[u(w)=\frac{w^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma},\; \gamma&gt;0,\; \gamma&lt;&gt;1\]</span> <span class="math display">\[u(w)=\log(w),\; \gamma=1.\]</span> The market comprises a riskless asset with rate of return <span class="math inline">\(r^{f}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> risky assets. Risky asset processes are geometric diffusions (<span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,N\)</span>): <span class="math display">\[\frac{dP_{i}}{P_{i}}=\mu_{i}dt+\sigma_{i}dB_{t},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(B_{t}\)</span> is a multivariate Brownian motion of dimension <span class="math inline">\((N,1)\)</span> and covariance matrix equal to the identity. The matrix <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{i}\)</span> is of size <span class="math inline">\((1,N)\)</span>. We denote by <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> the vector with components <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i}\)</span> i.e.Â the expected returns of the risky assets, and by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> the matrix obtained by stacking the â€˜linesâ€™ <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{i}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,N\)</span>). We assume <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is invertible, and put <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma=\sigma\sigma&#39;\)</span>. The vector of size <span class="math inline">\((N,1)\)</span> with all components equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is denoted <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. As a simplification, we assume all diffusion coefficients are constant, i.e.Â independent of time.</p>
<p>The value function <span class="math inline">\(V(t,W_{t})\)</span> is the solution to the problem: <span class="math display">\[V(t,W_{t})= \underset{\pi_{[t,T]}}{\text{max}} \; E_{t}\Big[u(W_{T})\Big]\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\text{s.t.}: \;\; \frac{dW_{u}}{W_{u}}=r^{f}du+\pi_{u}&#39;(\mu-r^{f}e)du+\pi_{u}&#39;\sigma dB_{u}.\]</span> The variable <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{[t,T]}\)</span> refers to the collection of risky assets portfolios <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{\tau}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\tau \in [t,T]\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\pi_{t}\)</span> is the vector of the portfolio positions on risky assets at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>). The principle of dynamic programming says that (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta&gt;0,\; t+\Delta \leq T\)</span>): <span class="math display">\[V(t,W_{t}) =\; \underset{\pi_{[t,t+\Delta]}}{\text{max}} \; E_{t}[V(t+\Delta,W_{t+\Delta})].\]</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Show that the value function is homogenous of degree <span class="math inline">\(1-\gamma\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \neq 1\)</span> and additive in <span class="math inline">\(\log(W)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Using Itoâ€™s lemma, decompose <span class="math inline">\(E_{t}[V(t+\Delta,W_{t+\Delta})-V(t,W_{t})]\)</span>.<br />
</li>
<li>Derive the infinitesimal version of the dynamic programming equation, taking the limit <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rightarrow 0\)</span> (HJB).</li>
<li>Using the first order condition of the infinitesimal optimization problem (HJB), derive the expression of the optimal portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{t}^{\star}\)</span> as a function of the partial derivatives of the value function (the use of the first order condition will be justified). Question <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> will be used to then get rid of the partial derivatives of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. Does the optimal portfolio depend on <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>?</li>
<li>Prove that: <span class="math display">\[\pi^{\star\prime}\Sigma \pi^{\star}=\frac{1}{\gamma}\pi^{\star\prime}(\mu-r^{f}e),\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\pi^{\star\prime}(\mu-r_{f}e)=\frac{1}{\gamma}\kappa^{2},\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=\sigma^{-1}(\mu-r_{f}e)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\kappa^{2}=\lambda\lambda&#39;\)</span>.</li>
<li>For each <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, determine the integral formula for <span class="math inline">\(W^{\gamma,\star}_{T}\)</span> as a fonction of initial wealth <span class="math inline">\(W_{0}\)</span> when the optimal policy is used.</li>
<li>Determine and then rank (as a function of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>) the limits <span class="math inline">\((\log(W^{\gamma,*}_{T})-\log(W_{1}))/T\)</span> (log growth). For which value of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is this quantity maximized? This quantity will be denoted <span class="math inline">\(\gamma^{\star}\)</span>. The corresponding optimal policy will be called the maximum growth investment policy.</li>
<li>We get back to a finite investment horizon <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Is the maximum growth investment policy determined in the previous question optimal for an investor with <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \neq \gamma^{*}\)</span>? Explain.</li>
