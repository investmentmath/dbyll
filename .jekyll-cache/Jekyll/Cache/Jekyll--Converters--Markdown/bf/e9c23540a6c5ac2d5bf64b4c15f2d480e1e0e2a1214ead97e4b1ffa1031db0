<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This note introduces a stylized financial contract, the zero coupon contract. The simple structure of this contract allows to discuss price dynamics without being bogged down in unnecessary complexity. The important features of price dynamics stand out clearly. We will see that price dynamics should be conceived as the solution to a terminal value problem. This will lead us to introduce the concept of a backward stochastic differential equation. This approach should be contrasted with the usual practice of specifying ad-hoc forward dynamics.</p>
<p>A financial contract is the promise of a stream of payments, usually spread across several periods. This latter feature creates analytical challenges. We will instead assume that our contract specifies a single payment at a given date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. This is what we call a <strong>zero coupon contract</strong>.</p>
<p>In the day to day practice of plain vanilla finance, the range of questions raised by the potential buyer of the contract is, ‘what is this payment likely to be? How uncertain is it? What is the worst case? What is the best case? How likely is the worst case? How likely is the best case?’. Once these questions have been answered (qualitatively at least), the buyer can judge whether the current price is attractive or not, i.e. whether the contract has the right return to risk characteristics. He will be able to form expectations on the distribution of the return to maturity. If the contract is liquid, the buyer can raise the same questions tomorrow and the day after, given the observed behavior of the market price. He can form short term expectations of the return. The realized short term return will be made up of its expected value and a surprise. This surprise will perhaps correspond to a change in the likely terminal payment. If not, the buyer will be able to conclude that the expected return to maturity has changed.</p>
<h1 id="zero-coupon-dynamics-the-fundamental-solution">Zero coupon dynamics: the fundamental solution</h1>
<p>To be relevant, modeling should closely mimic the above logic. To be specific, I’ll assume that uncertainty in the model is driven by a Brownian motion <span class="math inline">\(B=(B_{t})_{t \in [0,T]}\)</span> and that the filtration <span class="math inline">\(\cal{F}\)</span> is the minimal filtration generated by <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and satisfying the usual conditions. I now proceed to introduce the relevant mathematical objects. The terminal payment is an <span class="math inline">\({\cal F}_{T}-\)</span> measurable random variable <span class="math inline">\(X_{T}\)</span>. Technically, we impose the square integrability and strict positivity (almost surely) of <span class="math inline">\(X_{T}\)</span>. The technical conditions should make sure that we can apply the <a href="/math/2013/10/27/martingale-representation.html" title="MARTINGALE REPRESENTATION">martingale representation theorem</a>. We also need all processes to be almost surely strictly positive to formulate dynamics in a geometric way.</p>
<p>At a given date <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq t \leq T\)</span>, the expectation of the terminal payment is <span class="math inline">\(E_{t}[X_{T}]\)</span> which we will denote by <span class="math inline">\(X_{t}\)</span>. What is the dynamics of <span class="math inline">\((X_{t})_{t \in [0,T]}\)</span>? This process is a martingale and the <a href="/math/2013/10/27/martingale-representation.html" title="MARTINGALE REPRESENTATION">martingale representation theorem</a> tells us that there is an adapted process <span class="math inline">\(\zeta=(\zeta_{t})_{t \in [0,T]}\)</span> such that:<span class="math display">\[X_{t}=X_{0}+\int_{0}^{t}\zeta_{u}dB_{u}.\]</span> This can be written in differential form: <span class="math display">\[dX_{t}=\zeta_{t}dB_{t}.\]</span> This makes it clear that <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_{t}\)</span> measures the change in the expectation <span class="math inline">\(E_{t}[X_{T}]\)</span> that results from the shock <span class="math inline">\(dB_{t}\)</span>. To stress the backward angle to expectations dynamics, we note that expectations satisfy the equation:<span class="math display">\[X_{t}=X_{T}-\int_{t}^{T}\zeta_{u}dB_{u}.\]</span> This emphasizes the fact that expectations converge to the terminal variable <span class="math inline">\(X_{T}\)</span> which is the key piece of data in this problem. Finally, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is strictly positive and we can write <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{t}=\zeta_{t}/X_{t}\)</span>. The process <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> is called volatility process and the dynamics is determined by a geometric stochastic differential equation:<span class="math display">\[\frac{dX_{t}}{X_{t}}=\eta_{t}dB_{t}.\]</span></p>
<p>A historically important model of asset price dynamics is obtained when <span class="math inline">\(P_{t}=X_{t}=E_{t}[X_{T}]\)</span>. In this case, the price dynamics are determined by a stochastic integral. At any point in time, the price is expected to remain constant and all its fluctuations come from revisions in the expected value of the terminal payment. Periods where <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{t}\)</span> is low (respectively high) correspond to periods where the newsflow on the terminal payment is light (resp. heavy). We will call <span class="math inline">\((X_{t})_{t \in [0,T]}\)</span> {} of the zero coupon contract.</p>
<h1 id="the-case-of-a-constant-expected-return">The case of a constant expected return</h1>
<p>A more realistic model assumes that the financial contract has a constant positive expected return <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. We now have to modify the price dynamics. We assume that the price process is adapted and follows a geometric diffusion with drift <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>:<span class="math display">\[\frac{dP_{t}}{P_{t}}=rdt+Z_{t}dB_{t}.\]</span> We still want to complete this with the requisite that the price process at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> equals the terminal payment <span class="math inline">\(X_{T}\)</span>, any other value leading to an unrealistic arbitrage. We would therefore hope to be able to specify the complete dynamics with the terminal condition as:<span class="math display">\[\frac{dP_{t}}{P_{t}}=rdt+Z_{t}dB_{t},\,P_{T}=X_{T}\]</span> The stochastic differential equation is really the shorthand for:<span class="math display">\[P_{t}=P_{0}+\int_{0}^{t}rP_{u}du+\int_{0}^{t}Z_{u}P_{u}du,\]</span> and, to emphasize the terminal value condition, we can write:<span class="math display">\[P_{t}=X_{T}-\int_{t}^{T}rP_{u}du-\int_{t}^{T}Z_{u}P_{u}du.\]</span></p>
<p>A natural candidate for a solution is:<span class="math display">\[P_{t}=\exp(-r(T-t))X_{t}=E_{t}[\exp(-r(T-t))X_{T}],\]</span> and this indeed works. It is easily checked by applying Ito: <span class="math display">\[d(\exp(-r(T-t))X_{t})=r\exp(-r(T-t))X_{t}dt+\exp(-r(T-t))X_{t}\eta_{t}dB_{t},\]</span> or: <span class="math display">\[dP_{t}=rP_{t}dt+\eta_{t}P_{t}dB_{t}.\]</span> We have thus found a solution to our problem, with <span class="math inline">\(Z_{t}=\eta_{t}\)</span>, i.e. the volatility of the fundamental solution. This solution rises in expectations at a rate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and its fluctuations entirely reflect revisions of the terminal payment <span class="math inline">\(X_{T}\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="the-case-of-an-exogenous-expected-return">The case of an exogenous expected return</h1>
<p>We now assume we have a stochastic expected return process <span class="math inline">\((r_{t})_{t \in [0,T]}\)</span>. For the given terminal payment <span class="math inline">\(X_{T}\)</span> and the given expected return process <span class="math inline">\((r_{t})_{t \in [0,T]}\)</span> (the data), we are looking for an adapted price process <span class="math inline">\((P_{t})_{t \in [0,T]}\)</span> with an adapted volatility function <span class="math inline">\((Z_{t})_{t \in [0,T]}\)</span> such that: <span class="math display">\[\frac{dP_{t}}{P_{t}}=r_{t}dt+Z_{t}dB_{t},\,P_{T}=X_{T}.\]</span> In integral form, we are trying to solve: <span class="math display">\[P_{t}=X_{T}-\int_{t}^{T}r_{u}P_{u}du-\int_{t}^{T}Z_{u}P_{u}du.\]</span> This is an instance of a <strong>backward stochastic differential equation</strong>.</p>
<p>We observe that if there is a solution, we should have the following representation: <span class="math display">\[P_{t}=E_{t}[\exp(-\int_{t}^{T}r_{u}du)X_{T}].\]</span> Note that this is indeed equivalent to: <span class="math display">\[\exp(-\int_{0}^{t}r_{u}du)P_{t}=E_{t}[\exp(-\int_{0}^{T}r_{u}du)X_{T}]=E_{t}[\exp(-\int_{0}^{T}r_{u}du)P_{T}],\]</span> but then if <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> are solutions, the left hand side has to be a martingale (apply Ito) which means that the above equation should hold for any solution.</p>
<p>As for existence, it directly follows from the above observation. The variable <span class="math inline">\(Y_{t}=E_{t}[\exp(-\int_{0}^{T}r_{u}du)X_{T}]\)</span> defines a continuous martingale. It can be represented as a Brownian integral:<span class="math display">\[dY_{t}=Y_{t}Z_{t}dB_{t}.\]</span> If we define <span class="math inline">\(P_{t}\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(P_{t}=\exp(\int_{0}^{t}r_{u}du)Y_{t}\)</span> and we apply Ito, we get:<span class="math display">\[dP_{t}=r_{t}P_{t}dt+Z_{t}P_{t}dB_{t}.\]</span> We have thus found a solution to our simple backward stochastic differential equation.</p>
<p>In all cases we have seen, the volatility of the price is determined by the volatility of the martingale <span class="math inline">\((E_{t}[\exp(-\int_{0}^{T}r_{u}du)X_{T}])_{t \in [0,T]}\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\((r_{t})_{t \in [0,T]}\)</span> is deterministic, this is the same thing as the volatility of the martingale <span class="math inline">\((E_{t}[X_{T}])_{t \in [0,T]}\)</span>, i.e. fundamental volatility. But in general, it is not. We will come back to this in a later post.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>We have thus found a description of the price process which sticks to the financial logic. What drives the dynamics is two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>revisions of the terminal pay-off, as reflected in the dynamics of the fundamental solution <span class="math inline">\((X_{t})_{t \in [0,T]}\)</span>,</li>
<li>changes in the expected return.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two items determine the volatility function of the price process. We will see that price volatility obeys an accounting identity that links it to the two items above. There is thus more structure that in a traditional forward stochastic differential equation. As argued above, this structure is ideally suited to raising investment questions.</p>
