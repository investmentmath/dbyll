I"‹<p><em>This post introduces the dynamics of the value of a portfolio. It starts with an unfrequently rebalanced portfolio: portfolio weights are assumed â€˜simpleâ€™, i.e. piecewise constant. In this case, the portfolio value dynamics is trivial. More complex rebalancing schemes can be approximated using sequences of simple weighting schemes, just as a continuous function can be approximated using peacewise constant functions. The dynamics of portfolio value is then given by a stochastic integral. This example stresses an essential feature of stochastic integrals: portfolio weights (integrands) are forced to lag prices (integrators).</em></p>
