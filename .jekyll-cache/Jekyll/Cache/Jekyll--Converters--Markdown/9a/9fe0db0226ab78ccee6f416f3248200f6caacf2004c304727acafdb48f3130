I"¡<p><em>This post introduces the notion of a martingale. The concept is key to finance, but it is also central in stochastic analysis. A martingale is a process which, at any given date, is expected to remain at its current level in the future. In other words, its future increments (called martingale differences) are expected to be equal to zero. Picking a variable <span class="math inline">\(X_{T}\)</span>, the process <span class="math inline">\((E_{t}[X_{T}])_{t \in [0,T]}\)</span> is a martingale which is â€˜closedâ€™ by <span class="math inline">\(X_{T}\)</span>. The concept is illustrated using the discretized version of a martingale, namely a random walk with centered increments.Continuous time martingales with (loosely speaking) independent identically distributed increments are called Levy martingales. The post introduces two Levy martingales, the Brownian motion and the compensated Poisson proces.</em></p>
