<h2 id="mean-variance">Mean-Variance</h2>
<h3 id="exercise-1.1">Exercise 1.1</h3>
<p>Take the CARA normal set up (see <a href="/ensae/2014/10/07/static.html">this post</a>) without labour income. Assume that there is no riskless asset.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Solve the unconstrained optimization problem (no budget constraint). What is odd about the quadratic utility function?</p></li>
<li><p>Solve the constrained optimization problem (i.e.¬†including the budget constraint).</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the two solutions, concentrating on the achieved utility level. Why is the investor in 2. frustrated for high levels of wealth.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose now that we have a riskless asset. How does that affect the paradox identified in question 3 ?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="exercise-1.2">Exercise 1.2</h3>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/investmentmath/ENSAE/blob/master/efffront_exercise.ipynb">here</a> for the corresponding Jupyter/IPython notebook. See also <a href="/ensae/2015/10/17/ipython.html">this post</a> for some indications on how to use this resource.</p>
<p>We consider an investment universe comprising three assets, cash, a bond and equities. The cash rate is <span class="math inline">\(r^{f}=2\%\)</span>. The volatility of bonds is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{b}=7\%\)</span>, that of equities is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{e}=25\%\)</span>. The Sharpe ratio of bonds is assumed to be very low at <span class="math inline">\(0.05\)</span> and that of equities is chosen to be <span class="math inline">\(0.25\)</span>. Finally, the correlation of bonds and equities is assumed negative, at <span class="math inline">\(-0.2\)</span>. Thus bonds generate low returns, but they have hedging properties against equities (bonds tend to make gains when equities make losses).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Solve for the efficient frontier of the risky assets. Compute the minimum variance portfolio and its volatility.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the efficient frontier for the whole universe of assets. Compute the tangent portfolio, its volatility and its Sharpe ratio.</p></li>
<li><p>We consider the following utility functions: <span class="math display">\[r^{f}+\pi&#39;(\mu-r^{f}e)-\frac{\rho}{2}\pi&#39;\Sigma \pi.\]</span> To what value <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{\star}\)</span> does the tangent portfolio correspond ?</p></li>
<li><p>We consider two other values for <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, namely <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{l}=(3/5)*\rho_{\star}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{h}=1.5\rho_{\star}\)</span>. Compute the corresponding portfolios and their volatilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that the bond to equities proportion is constant along the efficient frontier. Suppose we added a no borrowing constraint. How would that constraint affect the high risk portfolio ?</p></li>
<li><p>Most financial advisors propose ranges of multi-asset portfolios which contain no cash. In particular a ‚Äòsafe‚Äô portfolio containing <span class="math inline">\(20\%\)</span> equities would typically have <span class="math inline">\(80\%\)</span> in bonds. What conditions concerning bonds‚Äô expected returns would be required for such portfolios to be on the efficient frontier ?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="exercise-1.3">Exercise 1.3</h3>
<p>In the previous exercise, we mention the possibility of adding a ‚Äòno borrowing constraint‚Äô to the initial mean-variance setup. This says that all portfolio weights should be positive. Solving such problems requires the use of quadratic programming techniques. The following <a href="https://github.com/investmentmath/ENSAE/blob/master/usingcvxopt.ipynb">notebook</a> uses this <a href="http://cvxopt.org/">package</a> to deal with this.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-1.4">Exercise 1.4</h3>
<p>The context is that studied in the section on mean variance efficiency with a riskless asset (see <a href="/ensae/2014/10/07/static.html">this post</a>). We consider an investor with the following utility function: <span class="math display">\[r^{f}+\pi&#39;(\mu-r^{f}e)-\frac{\rho}{2}\pi&#39;\Sigma \pi.\]</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Give the first order condition statisfied by the vector of risky asset positions. Derive a relationship relating the volatility of the optimal portfolio and its Sharpe ratio.</p></li>
<li><p>How does the risk budget consumed by the investor change with the Sharpe ratio of the tangent portfolio ? Describe the shape of the locus (in the mean standard-deviation space) of optimal portfolios (for our investor) as a function of the Sharpe ratio of the tangent portfolio.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="dynamics-discrete-time">Dynamics, discrete time</h2>
<h3 id="exercise-2.1">Exercise 2.1</h3>
<p>We consider the discrete time optmization problem with no interim consumption, CRRA terminal utility (date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>) of wealth with <span class="math inline">\(\rho &gt; 1\)</span>, no consumption and no income and finally i.i.d. returns (this is the first example of the course). The command is the set of portfolio proportions <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{t}\)</span> at each date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. We assume that there is a portfolio such that: <span class="math display">\[E\left[\frac{(\pi&#39;R)^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}\right]&gt;-\infty,\]</span> and in particular almost surely: <span class="math display">\[(\pi&#39;R)^{1-\rho}&gt;0.\]</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Write the optimization program as of date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for a given initial wealth <span class="math inline">\(w_{t}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the optimization program as of date <span class="math inline">\(T-1\)</span>, as a function of <span class="math inline">\(w_{T-1}\)</span>. Comment on the convexity/concavity of the objective function and that of the constraint. Describe the first order condition. Is it sufficient? We assume below that there is a solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(V_{T-1}(w)\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(w^{1-\rho}\)</span>. Determine the constant of proportionality as a function of the optimal portfolio.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve for the value function and the optimal portfolio at any date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> by recurrence.</p></li>
<li><p>Does the optimal portfolio depend on the investment horizon? Why?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="exercise-2.2">Exercise 2.2</h3>
<p>Take the same context as in 2.1, changing the utility function to log-utility. Solve the model following the same steps as above.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-2.3">Exercise 2.3</h3>
<p>We consider initially a two period framework. Investment takes place in date <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> and utility of wealth is measured in <span class="math inline">\(t=1\)</span>. There are two assets, a riskless asset with return <span class="math inline">\(R^{f}\)</span> and a risky asset with return <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{R_{1}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E[\tilde{R}_{1}]=\mu_{1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{R}_{1} \geq 0\)</span> almost surely. We assume that the support of the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{R}_{1}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(]0,+\infty[\)</span>. The investor maximizes the following utility function (<span class="math inline">\(\rho&gt;1\)</span>): <span class="math display">\[E\left[\frac{\tilde{(w_{1}}-\underline{w}_{1})^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}\right],\]</span> starting from an initial wealth <span class="math inline">\(w_{0}\)</span> to be invested in the two assets. The variable <span class="math inline">\(\underline{w}_{1}\)</span> is a floor the investor ascribes to wealth. We restrict the admissible portfolios to those which ensure that <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{w_{1}} \geq \underline{w}_{1}\)</span> almost surely.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Define the minimum wealth level <span class="math inline">\(\underline{w}_{0}\)</span> required to ensure that the set of admissible portfolios is not empty. We now assume <span class="math inline">\(w_{0} \geq \underline{w}_{0}\)</span> and we call <span class="math inline">\(w_{t}-\underline{w}_{t}\)</span> the surplus of date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(t=0,1\)</span> at this stage).</p></li>
<li><p>Assume that at date <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, a fraction <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{0}\)</span> of the surplus is invested in the risky asset. Explain why <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{0}\)</span> should be lower than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and greater than zero. Show that: <span class="math display">\[w_{1}-\underline{w}_{1}=(w_{0}-\underline{w}_{0})(R^{f}+\pi_{0}(\tilde{R}_{1}-R^{f})).\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The value function, i.e.¬†the utility level reached at the optimum is noted <span class="math inline">\(V_{0}(\cdot)\)</span> and should be seen as a function of the surplus. Show that this function is homogenous of degree <span class="math inline">\(1-\rho\)</span> and give the program that determines the optimal weight <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{\star}_{0}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume now that we have a whole sequence of dates <span class="math inline">\(t=0, 1,\ldots,T\)</span> with utility measured at date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[E\left[\frac{\tilde{(w_{T}}-\underline{w}_{T})^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}\right].\]</span> Returns are as above, with a constant cash return and i.i.d. risky asset returns. Explain why the optimal investment <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{\star}_{t}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(t=0,\ldots,T-1\)</span>) is stationary in time.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="exercise-2.4">Exercise 2.4</h3>
<p>We consider the discrete time program with i.i.d. returns and CRRA terminal utility of wealth (<span class="math inline">\(\rho&gt;1\)</span>):<br />
<span class="math display">\[E_{t}\left[\frac{\tilde{w}_{T}^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}\right],\]</span> as expected from date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Final wealth is required to be strictly positive. We have a riskless asset with return <span class="math inline">\(R^{f}\)</span> (constant across time), and a single risky asset with log-normal return <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{R}_{t+1}=\exp(\mu(\tilde{x}_{t})+\sigma \tilde{x}_{t+1})\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\((\tilde{x}_{t})\)</span> is a sequence of i.i.d. <span class="math inline">\({\cal N}(0,1)\)</span> variables.</p>
<p>As of date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the realization <span class="math inline">\(x_{t}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{x}_{t}\)</span> is known. The return <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{R}_{t+1}\)</span> thus has a lognormal distribution <span class="math inline">\({\cal LN}(\mu(x_{t}),\sigma)\)</span>. We can write <span class="math inline">\(\mu(x_{t})=\mu_{t}\)</span>. We will assume the <span class="math inline">\(\mu(x)\)</span> is a monotonous function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is constant, the price of the risky asset follows a geometric random walk.</p>
<p>Wealth in date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is denoted <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{w}_{t}\)</span> (random variable) or <span class="math inline">\(w_{t}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Remark: don‚Äôt hesitate to exchange derivation and integration in this problem.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>State the optimization program to be solved at date <span class="math inline">\(T-1\)</span>, assuming that the command variable is the weight invested in the risky asset, <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{T-1}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that the derivative of the criterion to be maximized reads: <span class="math display">\[w_{T-1}^{1-\rho}E_{T-1}[(\tilde{R}_{T}-R^{f})(R^{f}+\pi(\tilde{R}_{T}-R^{f}))^{-\rho}].\]</span> In a similar way, show that the second derivative is negative and that therefore the function to be maximized is concave.</p></li>
<li><p>Why can we assume <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq \pi_{T-1} \leq 1\)</span> ? Show that the optimal quantity of risky assets is strictly positive when <span class="math inline">\(\exp(\mu_{T-1}+\sigma^{2}/2) &gt; R^{f}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Noting that the first order condition implies: <span class="math display">\[E_{T-1}[(\tilde{R}_{T}-R^{f})(wR^{f}+w\pi^{\star}(\tilde{R}_{T}-R^{f}))^{-\rho}]=0,\]</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(w&gt;0\)</span>, establish: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\pi^{\star}}{R^{f}}=-\frac{E_{T-1}[(\tilde{R}_{T}-R^{f})(R^{f}+\pi^{\star}(\tilde{R}_{T}-R^{f}))^{-\rho-1}]}
{E_{T-1}[(\tilde{R}_{T}-R^{f})^{2}(R^{f}+\pi^{\star}(\tilde{R}_{T}-R^{f}))^{-\rho-1}]}.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) We consider an increase <span class="math inline">\(d\theta &gt; 0\)</span> in the mean of the lognormal return <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{R}_{T}\)</span>. The new return is <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{R}_{T}+d\theta\)</span>. The induced change in the optimal position in the risky asset is <span class="math inline">\(d\pi^{\star}\)</span>. Show that the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(d\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\pi^{\star}\)</span> is: <span class="math display">\[\frac{d\pi^{\star}}{d\theta}=\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{E_{T-1}[(R^{f}+\pi(\tilde{R}_{T}-R^{f}))^{-\rho}]}
{E_{T-1}[(\tilde{R}_{T}-R^{f})^{2}(R^{f}+\pi(\tilde{R}_{T}-R^{f}))^{-\rho-1}]}+\frac{(\pi^{\star})^{2}}{1+R^{f}}.\]</span> Deduce that the demand in risky asset is increasing in <span class="math inline">\(d\theta\)</span>. Why can‚Äôt we conclude from this that an increase in <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{T-1}\)</span> increases the demand from the risky asset?</p></li>
<li><p>Show that the value function <span class="math inline">\(V_{T-1}(w_{T-1},x_{T-1})\)</span> can be written: <span class="math display">\[V_{T-1}(w_{T-1},x_{T-1})=\psi_{T-1}(x_{T-1})\frac{w_{T-1}^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho},\]</span> and give the expression for <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{T-1}(\cdot)\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{T-1}^{\star}(x_{T-1})\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{T-1}\)</span> is positive.</p></li>
<li><p>The derivative of the value function with <span class="math inline">\(V_{T-1}(w_{T-1},x_{T-1})\)</span> with respect to the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{T-1}(x_{T-1})\)</span> can be computed as if the optimal portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{T-1}^{\star}(\mu_{T-1})\)</span> was fixed (envelope theorem). Assuming one can exchange derivation and integration, show that <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{T-1}(x_{T-1})\)</span> is an increasing function of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{T-1}(x_{T-1})\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Remark: if <span class="math inline">\(\mu(x)\)</span> is decreasing in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, it means that a negative return shock enhances the prospective return. In that case, <span class="math inline">\(\psi(x)\)</span> is an increasing function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><p>Define the optimization program as of date <span class="math inline">\(T-2\)</span> using the dynamic programming principle. Check that the function to be optimized is concave so that the optimization program is well defined.</p></li>
<li><p>(In progress) Derive the first order condition of this problem. Assuming that the sign of: <span class="math display">\[(1-\rho)\text{Cov}[\psi(\tilde{x}_{T-1}),(\tilde{R}_{T-1}-R^{f})(R^{f}+\pi(\tilde{R}_{T-1}-R^{f}))^{-\rho}],\]</span> is well defined uniformly in <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> and reflecting the monotonicity in <span class="math inline">\(\psi(\cdot)\)</span>, discuss the impact of <span class="math inline">\(\psi(\cdot)\)</span> on the optimal investment level <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{\star}\)</span>.</p></li>

<h3 id="exercise-2.5">Exercise 2.5</h3>
<p>Assume an investor maximizes the expected utility of terminal wealth:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\underset{\pi_{t},\pi_{t+1},\ldots,\pi_{T-1}}{\text{max}} \; E_{t}[u(W_{T})]\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\text{s.t.}:\]</span> <span class="math display">\[W_{T}=W_{t}(\pi_{t}&#39;R_{t+1})\ldots(\pi_{T-1}&#39;R_{T}),\]</span> with the usual notations. We assume the returns are i.i.d..

The notation <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{*}_{T-2}(\cdot)\)</span> (notation for a function) emphasizes that the investment plan is contingent on the state variable of date <span class="math inline">\(T-1\)</span>. Assume the investor chooses a suboptimal (from the dynamic programming point of view) portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{T-2}\)</span>, and then implements a contingent portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{T-1}(\cdot)\)</span>. Show that expected utility for that set of plans is inferior to that generated by <span class="math inline">\((\pi^{*}_{T-2},\pi^{*}_{T-1}(\cdot))\)</span>.</li>
