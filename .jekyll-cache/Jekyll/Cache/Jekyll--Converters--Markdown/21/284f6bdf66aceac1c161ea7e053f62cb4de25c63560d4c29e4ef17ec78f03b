I"õ<p><em>In this section of the course, I review the static portfolio choice problem. The investor chooses a portfolio structure which is then left alone. The investment criterion is the expected utility of wealth at a terminal date. I briefly review specifications for the utility function together with risk aversion concepts. I look at the case of constant absolute risk aversion and normal returns, with or without labour income. I then introduce mean variance preferences, linking them to expected utility. Mean variance with and without a risk free asset is studied. The link between mean variance preferences and the expected returns/beta relationship is explained (the key ingredient of the CAPM). I then touch on the implementation problem.</em></p>
