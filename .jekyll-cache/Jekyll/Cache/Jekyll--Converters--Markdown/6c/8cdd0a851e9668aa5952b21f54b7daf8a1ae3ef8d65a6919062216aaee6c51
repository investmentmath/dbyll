I"Š<p><em>As explained in <a href="/math/2013/05/29/quadratic-variation-and-stochastic-integration.html" title="quadratic variation and stochastic integration">this post</a>, stochastic integration has initially been developed under the condition <span class="math inline">\(E\left[\int_{0}^{T}H^{2}_{s}d[M]_{s}\right]&lt;\infty\)</span>. This condition has then been replaced by the more general condition <span class="math inline">\(P\left(\int_{0}^{T}H^{2}_{s}d[M]_{s}&lt;\infty \right)=1\)</span>. This turns out to be the most general integrability condition under which stochastic integration can be defined. This post introduces the idea behind this generalization. The process whereby stochastic integration is thus generalized is called localization. In words, the above condition means that the set of trajectories for which integrated variance remains bounded should have probability one.</em></p>
