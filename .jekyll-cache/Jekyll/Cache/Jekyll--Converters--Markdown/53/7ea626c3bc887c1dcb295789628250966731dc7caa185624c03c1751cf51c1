I"~<p><em>This post introduces zero coupon contracts, contracts which promise a single payment at a fixed date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Truthful to <a href="/finance/2013/02/25/what-is-a-financial-asset.html" title="What is a financial asset">this introductory post</a>, the price process is derived backwards. The terminal pay-off is modeled as a random variable usually not known before maturity. The price process is then defined as adapted to the filtration, with a drift which is the instantaneous expected return and converging to the terminal pay-off at maturity. This is an example of a very simple backward stochastic differential equation. The data of the zero coupon contract is the terminal pay-off and the drift (expected return) process. A key component of the solution is the volatility of the price process, which can be related to the data of the problem.</em></p>
