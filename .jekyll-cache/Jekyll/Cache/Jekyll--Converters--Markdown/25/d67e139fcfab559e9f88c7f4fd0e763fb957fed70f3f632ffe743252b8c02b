<p>I consider an investment universe composed of cash (index <span class="math inline">\(i=0\)</span>) with return <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> risky assets (indices <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,N\)</span>) with expected returns <span class="math inline">\(\mu=(\mu_{1},\ldots,\mu_{N})&#39;\)</span> and covariance matrix <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> (dimension <span class="math inline">\((N,N)\)</span>). Each investor builds a portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pi=(\pi_{0},\tilde{\pi})\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{0}\)</span> is the proportion of wealth invested in cash and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\pi}\)</span> is a vector of size <span class="math inline">\((N,1)\)</span> recording the proportions invested on the risky assets. The portfolio vector satisfies the following contraint: <span class="math display">\[\pi_{0}+\tilde{\pi}&#39;e=1,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the vector of size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> with all components equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="part-1">Part <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span></h2>
<h2 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h2>
<p>Investor preferences are assumed quadratic (expected utility): <span class="math display">\[\pi_{0}r+\tilde{\pi}&#39;\mu-\frac{\rho}{2}\tilde{\pi}&#39;\Sigma\tilde{\pi},\]</span> indexed by <span class="math inline">\(\rho&gt;0\)</span>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Letâ€™s assume investors access risky assets exclusively through a portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\pi}_{e}\)</span> (satisfying <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\pi}_{e}&#39;e=1\)</span>), with expected return <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{e}\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{e}^{2}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\pi}_{\rho}\)</span> be the proportion of portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\pi}_{e}\)</span> bought by an investor with parameter <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> (her risky asset portfolio is therefore <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\pi}_{\rho}=\hat{\pi}_{\rho}\tilde{\pi}_{e}\)</span>). Compute <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\pi}_{\rho}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the situation described in question 1, all investors hold different proportions of the index <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\pi}_{e}\)</span>. We are now interested in marginal changes in risky asset positions investors could make to improve their expected utility level. Compute the gradient of expected utility of investor <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, measured at <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\pi}_{\rho}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that the gradient is independent of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, and that component <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is equal to: <span class="math display">\[(\mu_{i}-r)-\beta_{i,e}\eta,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{i,e}\)</span> is the beta of asset <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> with respect to the index (the beta of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\text{Cov}(y,x)/\text{Var}(x)\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> is a constant that will be expressed as a return.</p></li>
<li><p>To improve expected utility, one can move positions in the direction given by the gradient. Explain why all investors agree on the assets to buy and sell in this process.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="part-2">Part <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span></h2>
<p>In this part, the returns of the assets between date <span class="math inline">\(t-1\)</span> and date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> will be noted <span class="math inline">\(R_{i,t}\)</span> while the rates of return are written <span class="math inline">\(r_{i,t}\)</span>. The vector (of size <span class="math inline">\((N+1,1)\)</span>) of returns is <span class="math inline">\(R_{t}\)</span>. Note that this vector contains the cash return. I assume initially that the sequence of returns is i.i.d.. As usual, the vector of size <span class="math inline">\((N+1,1)\)</span> with all components equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is noted <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(w_{t}\)</span> be the level of wealth. At any date <span class="math inline">\(t&lt;T\)</span>, the investor maximizes the expected value of the log of wealth at horizon <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="exercice-2">Exercice 2</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Describe the optimization program and define the value function.</p></li>
<li><p>Give the dynamic programming equation between date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Using backward induction, show that the value function has the following structure: <span class="math display">\[V_{t}(w_{t})=\log(w_{t})+A_{t},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A_{t}\)</span> is a constant. Conclude that the investor solves the same optimization problem (which one ?) at each date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Give the first order condition of the problem identified in question <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. Is this condition sufficient ?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We now assume that there is a solution to the optimization problem identified in question <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Assume that an investor with infinite investment horizon solves the sequential optimization problem defined above. This leads to a same optimal portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{*}\)</span> being chosen in each period. Prove that this policy beats any other static portfolio choice <span class="math inline">\(\pi\neq\pi_{*}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I now drop the assumption that returns are i.i.d.. The conditional distribution <span class="math inline">\({\cal L}_{t}(R_{t+1})\)</span> of period <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span> returns as seen from period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is supposed to be characterized by a markovian state variable <span class="math inline">\(x_{t}\)</span>. More generally, we assume that for any random variable <span class="math inline">\(y_{t+1}\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[E_{t}[y_{t+1}]=E[y_{t+1}|x_{t}].\]</span> It is reminded that <span class="math inline">\(E[y_{t+1}|x_{t}]\)</span> can be written <span class="math inline">\(g(x_{t})\)</span> where the function <span class="math inline">\(g(\cdot)\)</span> is specific to the random variable <span class="math inline">\(y_{t+1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The optimization problem is otherwise unchanged.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>Define the state variable of the new problem, and give the new dynamic programming equation.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that the value function now has the following structure: <span class="math display">\[V_{t}(x_{t},w_{t})=\log(w_{t})+A_{t}(x_{t}).\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Which optimization problem is solved at each date as a result ? The solution will be noted <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{t}^{*}(x_{t})\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I remind that a martingale difference is a process <span class="math inline">\((z_{t})_{t\in \mathbb{N}}\)</span> satisfying <span class="math inline">\(E_{t}[z_{t+1}]=0\)</span>. We will admit that under some condition on second moments, almost surely: <span class="math display">\[\lim_{T \rightarrow +\infty}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}z_{t}=0.\]</span></p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>We now want to extend the result of question <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> to the new context. An investor chooses at each date the portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{t}(x_{t})\)</span>. Show that asymptotically, the wealth process generated by <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{t}^{*}(x_{t})\)</span> dominates that generated by <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{t}(x_{t})\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Extend the above results to the continuous time context, starting with the i.i.d. case.</p></li>
