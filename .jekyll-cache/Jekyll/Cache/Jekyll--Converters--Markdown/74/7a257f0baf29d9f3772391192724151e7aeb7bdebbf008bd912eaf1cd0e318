I"k<p><em>The previous posts introduced stochastic integration of an integrand <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> against an integrator <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> which was chosen to be a continuous martingale. Continuous semimartingales are now defined as continuous processes that can be decomposed into a continuous martingale and a continuous finite variation process. Because ‘standard’ integration theory allows to integrate against finite variation processes, one can easily extend stochastic integration from continuous martingale integrators to continuous semimartingale integrators.</em></p>
