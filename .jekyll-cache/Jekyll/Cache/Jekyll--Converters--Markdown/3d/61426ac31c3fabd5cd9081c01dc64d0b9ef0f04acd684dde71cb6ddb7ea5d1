I"&<p><em>Building on the <a href="/finance/2013/04/06/portfolio-returns.html" title="PORTFOLIO RETURNS">portfolio return post</a>, this article describes the stochastic inregral <span class="math inline">\(\int_{0}^{\cdot}H_{u}dM_{u}\)</span> of an integrand <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> against a martingale <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> as a martingale transform. The integral re-weights the increments of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> using a system of ‘predetermined’ weights in such a way that the resulting process remains a martingale. The preservation of the martingale property is a key requirement of the standard stochastic integration theory. The sensitivity of the resulting martingale <span class="math inline">\(\int_{0}^{\cdot}H_{u}dM_{u}\)</span> with respect to the infinitesimal increments of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is an instanciation of the concept of Malliavin derivative. The post ends by considering the martingale representation property which plays a key role in financial theory.</em></p>
