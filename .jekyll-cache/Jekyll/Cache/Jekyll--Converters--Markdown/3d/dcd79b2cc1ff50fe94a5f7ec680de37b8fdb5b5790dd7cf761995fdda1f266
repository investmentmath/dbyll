<h2 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h2>
<p>We are in a static investment setup. The investment universe is made of cash (asset with index <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>) earning a riskless rate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> risky assets with rates of return <span class="math inline">\((\tilde{r}_{i})_{i=1,\ldots,N}\)</span>. The vector of risky asset risky is denoted <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\pmb{r}}\)</span> (size <span class="math inline">\((N,1)\)</span>). Its mean is <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{\mu}\)</span> and its variance <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is assumed to be positive definite (and therefore invertible).</p>
<p>A portfolio is a vector of proportions. The proportion invested on cash is <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{0}\)</span> and the vector of risky asset positions is <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{\pi}\)</span> (size <span class="math inline">\((N,1)\)</span>). The vector of size <span class="math inline">\((N,1)\)</span> with all components equal to one is denoted <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{e}\)</span>. A portfolio therefore satisfies: <span class="math display">\[\pi_{0}+\pmb{e}&#39;\pmb{\pi}=1.\]</span> We will assume <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{e}&#39;\Sigma^{-1}(\pmb{\mu}-r\pmb{e})&gt;0\)</span>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Given an excess return target <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p}-r&gt;0\)</span>, find the risky portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{\pi}_{\mu_{p}-r}\)</span> with minimum variance amongst portfolios that achieve the return target <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p}-r&gt;0\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{\mu_{p}-r}\)</span> be the lagrange multiplier in the optimization problem. Changing <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{\mu_{p}-r}\)</span> and therefore <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{\mu_{p}-r}\)</span> allows to map the efficient frontier of the complete problem (cash plus risky asset). What is the geometrical shape of this curve in the (x=standard deviation,y=excess-return) space?</p></li>
<li><p>Show that for a certain value of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p}\)</span>, say <span class="math inline">\(\mu^{*}\)</span>, the optimal risky asset portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{\pi}^{*}\)</span> is fully invested, i.e.Â <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{e}&#39;\pmb{\pi}^{*}=1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the definition of the risky assets efficient frontier?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is the risky assets efficient frontier always below the efficient frontier of the complete problem? Describe the overall geometric situation, including the relative position of the different curves at <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{\pi}^{*}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that: <span class="math display">\[\pmb{\pi}_{\mu_{p}-r}=\frac{\mu_{p}-r}{\mu^{*}-r}\pmb{\pi}^{*}.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>What is the interpretation of the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\pmb{\pi}_{\mu_{p}-r}\)</span>? Consider the first order condition satisfied by the Lagrangian at the optimum of the problem described in question <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. What is its marginalist interpretation?</p></li>
<li><p>Using the proportionality condition established in question <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, show that the first order condition for an investor with excess return target <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p}-r&gt;0\)</span> is in fact equivalent to that of an investor with excess return target <span class="math inline">\(\mu^{*}-r\)</span>. As a consequence, all investors actually apply the same trade-off?</p></li>
<li><p>Show that: <span class="math display">\[\mu_{i}-r=\beta(\tilde{r}_{i},\tilde{r}^{*})(\mu^{*}-r),\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{r}^{*}=\pmb{\pi}^{*\prime}\tilde{\pmb{r}}\)</span>. Give the explicit value of <span class="math inline">\(\beta(\tilde{r}_{i},\tilde{r}^{*})\)</span> as well as its interpretation.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose the economy is composed of mean-variance investors who share the same return and risk expectations but have different levels of risk aversion. The risky asset supply is assumed exogenous. It must be held by the set of investors. The overall portfolio is called the market portfolio. Using the above results, explain how the excess return of individual assets relate to the excess return of the market portfolio.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="exercice-2">Exercice 2</h2>
<p>The setup is that of the previous exercise. Assumptions on risk and expected returns are specialized further. Tildas are used to denote random variables.</p>
<p>Assume the risky asset returns satisfy: <span class="math display">\[\tilde{r}_{i}=\mu_{i}+\sigma_{i}\tilde{\epsilon}_{i},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\((\tilde{\epsilon}_{i})_{i=1,\ldots,N}\)</span> are i.i.d., with zero mean and variance equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. As usual, the cash return is denoted <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</p>
<p>Within questions <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, portfolios are assumed to be fully invested on risky assets (i.e.Â <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{e}&#39;\pmb{\pi}=1\)</span>).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Determine the vector of weights <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{\pi}^{mv}\)</span> of the minimum variance portfolio.</p></li>
<li><p>For a given portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{\pi}\)</span>, the profile of sensivities to risk is the vector of formal derrivatives of <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{\pi}&#39;\tilde{\pmb{r}}\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\((\tilde{\epsilon}_{i})_{i=1,\ldots,N}\)</span>. Compute the profile of sensitivities of <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{\pi}^{mv}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A portfolio is more diversified if its sensitivity profile constant. I note <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{\pi}^{ew}\)</span> the portfolio with a constant sensitivity profile. Compute <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{\pi}^{ew}\)</span> and give its variance.</p></li>
<li><p>Under what condition do we have <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{\pi}^{mv}=\pmb{\pi}^{ew}\)</span>? Why is <span class="math inline">\(\pmb{\pi}^{mv}\)</span> usually underdiversified?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I now consider portfolios that are invested on all assets, i.e.Â including cash (<span class="math inline">\(\pi_{0}+\pmb{e}&#39;\pmb{\pi}=1\)</span>). In this context, risk can be reduced witout limit by reducing the weight of risky assets (<span class="math inline">\(\pmb{e}&#39;\pmb{\pi}\)</span>).</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Assuming <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i}-r=\lambda \sigma_{i}&gt;0\)</span> (the risk structure is unchanged), find the efficient portfolio with target excess return <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p}-r&gt;0\)</span>. Give its sensitivity profile and comment.</li>
</ol>
<p>We now consider a more general condition where <span class="math inline">\(\text{Cov}(\tilde{r}_{i},\tilde{r}_{j})=\rho \sigma_{i}\sigma_{j},\; i\neq j\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> neither <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> nor <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> (homogenous correlations). The assumption <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i}-r=\lambda \sigma_{i}&gt;0\)</span> is maintained.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Find the efficient portfolio with target excess return <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p}-r&gt;0\)</span>. Give its sensitivity profile and comment. Compare with question 5.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a given portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, I note <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{p}(\pi)\)</span> its standard deviation. The derivative <span class="math inline">\(\partial{\sigma_{p}}/\partial \pi_{i}\)</span> is called the marginal contribution to risk of position <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{i}\)</span>. The total contribution to risk of position <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{i}\)</span> is defined as <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{i}\partial{\sigma_{p}}/\partial \pi_{i}\)</span>.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>In the context of mean-variance optimization (with cash and risky assets) and a target excess return, what relation is satisfied by the marginal contribution to risk (use the first order condition).</p></li>
<li><p>Show that the total contributions to risk sum to the standard error: <span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^{N}\pi_{i}\frac{\partial{\sigma_{p}}}{\partial \pi_{i}}=\sigma_{p}.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Show that in the context of question <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>, total contributions to risk are equal.</p></li>
<li><p>Some people propose to build portfolios by equalizing total contributions to risk. What do you think of this principle? Is this a credible diversification principle?</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="exercice-3">Exercice 3</h2>
<p>We have a multivariate Brownian motion <span class="math inline">\((B_{t})_{t \in \mathbb{R}_{+}}\)</span> of size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Its covariance matrix is the identity.</p>
<p>There are <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> risky assets with dynamics given by (for <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,N\)</span>): <span class="math display">\[d\log(P_{i,t})=\gamma_{i,t}dt+\xi_{i,t}dB_{t},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\xi_{i,t}\)</span> is of size <span class="math inline">\((1,N)\)</span>. The covariance matrix of the risky assets is assumed invertible.</p>
<p>All portfolios are assumed fully invested on risky assets, with all weights strictly positive. It is given by a set of weights <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{t}=(\pi_{i,t})_{i=1,\ldots,N}\)</span>. The value process is <span class="math inline">\(V_{\pi,t}\)</span>. Its dynamics is: <span class="math display">\[d\log(V_{\pi,t})=\gamma_{\pi,t}dt+\xi_{\pi,t}dB_{t}.\]</span></p>
<p>The market is composed of one unit of each asset <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. The total value of the market is thus: <span class="math display">\[V_{\mu,t}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}P_{i,t}.\]</span> It is the value of a portfolio characterized by weights <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{t}=(\mu_{i,t})_{i=1,\ldots,N}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i,t}=P_{i,t}/V_{\mu,t}\)</span>. We will assume that all these weights are strictly positive for almost all price trajectories (i.e.Â donât shy away from dividing by the weights).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Give the diffusions followed by <span class="math inline">\(dP_{i,t}/P_{i,t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dV_{\pi,t}/V_{\pi,t}\)</span>. Their respective drifts will be noted <span class="math inline">\(r_{i,t}\)</span> et <span class="math inline">\(r_{\pi,t}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that: <span class="math display">\[d\log(V_{\pi,t})=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\pi_{i,t}d\log(P_{i,t})+\gamma^{*}_{\pi,t}dt,\]</span> and give the expression for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma^{*}_{\pi,t}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose we have another portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{t}=(\eta_{i,t})_{i=1,\ldots,N}\)</span>, with value <span class="math inline">\(V_{\eta,t}\)</span>, show that: <span class="math display">\[d\log(V_{\pi,t}/V_{\eta,t})=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\pi_{i,t}d\log(P_{i,t}/V_{\eta,t})+\gamma^{*}_{\pi,t}dt.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Show that: <span class="math display">\[\gamma^{*}_{\pi,t}dt=-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\pi_{i,t}d\log(P_{i,t}/V_{\pi,t}).\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Show that: <span class="math display">\[\gamma^{*}_{\pi,t}dt \geq 0.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Show that: <span class="math display">\[d\log(V_{\pi,t}/V_{\mu,t})=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\pi_{i,t}d\log(\mu_{i,t})+\gamma^{*}_{\pi,t}dt.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>We now choose for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> the equally weighted portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{i,t}=1/N\)</span>.Given a vector <span class="math inline">\(x=(x_{i})_{i=1,\ldots,N}\)</span> with strictly positive components, I note: <span class="math display">\[S(x)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\log(x_{i}).\]</span> Show that <span class="math inline">\(S(\cdot)\)</span> is concave, has a maximum is <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, and tends to <span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> towards the edges of the simplex (<span class="math inline">\(\{x \in \mathbb{R}^{N}_{+}|\forall i, x_{i}&gt;0,\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}=1\}\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>Supposing <span class="math inline">\(\int_{0}^{t}\gamma^{*}_{\pi,u}du\)</span> is negligible, comment on the performance of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> relative to <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> as a fonction of the evolution of <span class="math inline">\(S(\cdot)\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> et <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. If portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is equally weighted at date <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, can portfolio <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> outperform the market portfolio?</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that we can ensure that <span class="math inline">\(S(\mu_{t}) \geq B\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> est une constante) and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma^{*}_{\pi,t}\geq \epsilon &gt;0\)</span> on almost all price trajectories, show that the equally weighted portfolio outperforms the market portfolio almost surely in finite time.</p></li>
