I"s<p><em>This post takes another stab at return compounding, when price trajectories potentially are of infinite variation. Starting from first principles, it shows that the differential equation followed by the price can either be a standard differential equation or a stochastic differential equation. The key concept is the quadratic variation of trajectories.</em></p>
